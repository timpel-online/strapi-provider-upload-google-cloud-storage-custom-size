**Non-Official** Google Cloud Storage Provider Custom Size for Strapi Upload

## Installation

Install the package from your app root directory

with `npm`
```
npm install strapi-provider-upload-google-cloud-storage --save
```

or `yarn`
```
yarn add strapi-provider-upload-google-cloud-storage

## <a name="create-bucket"></a> Create your Bucket on Google Cloud Storage

The bucket should be created with **fine grained** access control, as the plugin will configure uploaded files with public read access.

### How to create a bucket ?
- https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets

### Where my bucket can be located ?

## <a name="setup-auth"></a> Setting up Google authentication

If you are deploying to a Google Cloud Platform product that supports [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#finding_credentials_automatically) (such as App Engine, Cloud Run, and Cloud Functions etc.), then you can skip this step. 

If you are deploying outside GCP, then follow these steps to set up authentication:

1. In the GCP Console, go to the **Create service account key** page.
    - **[Go to the create service account key page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey)**
2. From the **Service account** list, select **New service account**.
3. In the **Service account name** field, enter a name.
4. From the **Role** list, select **Cloud Storage > Storage Admin**.
5. Select `JSON` for **Key Type**
6. Click **Create**. A JSON file that contains your key downloads to your computer.
7. Copy the full content of the downloaded JSON file
8. Open the Strapi configuration file 
9. Paste it into the "Service Account JSON" field (as `string` or `JSON`, be careful with indentation)

## Setting up the configuration file

You will find below many examples of configurations, for each example :

1. If you are deploying outside GCP, then follow the steps above [Setting up Google authentication](#setup-auth)
2. Set the `#bucketName#` field and replace `Bucket-name` by yours [previously create](#create-bucket)
3. Default `baseUrl` is working, but you can replace it by yours (if you use a custom baseUrl)
4. Save the configuration file
5. Enjoy !

**Example with application default credentials (minimal setup)**

This works only for deployment to GCP products such as App Engine, Cloud Run, and Cloud Functions etc.

Edit `./config/plugins.js`

```javascript
module.exports = {
    upload: {
        provider: 'google-cloud-storage',
        providerOptions: {
            bucketName: '#bucketName#',
            publicFiles: false,
            uniform: false,
            basePath: '',
        },
    },
    //...
}
```

**Example with credentials for outside GCP account**

Edit `./config/plugins.js`

```javascript
module.exports = {
    upload: {
        provider: 'google-cloud-storage',
        providerOptions: {
            bucketName: '#bucketName#',
            publicFiles: true,
            uniform: false,
            serviceAccount: {}, // replace `{}` with your serviceAccount JSON object
            baseUrl: 'https://storage.googleapis.com/{bucket-name}',
            basePath: '',
        },
      },
    //...
}
```

If you have different upload provider by environment, you can override `plugins.js` file by environment : 
- `config/env/development/plugins.js`
- `config/env/production/plugins.js`

This file, under `config/env/{env}/` will be overriding default configuration present in main folder `config`.

**Example with environment variable**

```javascript
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
    upload: {
      provider: 'google-cloud-storage',
      providerOptions: {
        serviceAccount: env('GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT'),
        bucketName: env('GCS_BUCKET_NAME'),
        basePath: env('GCS_BASE_PATH'),
        baseUrl: env('GCS_BASE_URL'),
        publicFiles: env('GCS_PUBLIC_FILES'),
        uniform: env('GCS_UNIFORM'),
      },
    },
    //...
});
```

Environment variable can be changed has your way.

## How to configure variable ?

#### `serviceAccount` :

JSON data provide by Google Account (explained before). If you are deploying to a GCP product that supports Application Default credentials, you can leave this omitted, and authentication will work automatically.

Can be set as a String, JSON Object, or omitted.

#### `bucketName` :

The name of the bucket on Google Cloud Storage.
- Required

You can find more information on Google Cloud documentation.

#### `baseUrl` :

Define your base Url, first is default value :
- https://storage.googleapis.com/{bucket-name}
- https://{bucket-name}
- http://{bucket-name}

#### `basePath` :

Define base path to save each media document.
- Optional

#### `publicFiles`:

Boolean to define a public attribute to file when it upload to storage.
- Default value : `true`
- Optional

#### `uniform`:

Boolean to define uniform access, when uniform bucket-level access is enabled
- Default value : `false`
- Optional

## FAQ

### Common errors

#### Uniform access 

`Error uploading file to Google Cloud Storage: Cannot insert legacy ACL for an object when uniform bucket-level access is enabled`

When this error occurs, you need to set `uniform` variable to `true`.

#### Service Account JSON

`Error: Error parsing data "Service Account JSON", please be sure to copy/paste the full JSON file`

When this error occurs, it's probably because you have missed something with the service account json configuration.

Follow this step :
- Open your `ServiceAccount` json file
- Copy the full content of the file
- Paste it under the variable `ServiceAccount` in `plugins.js` config file in JSON
